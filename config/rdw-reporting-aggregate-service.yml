# Annotated configuration for RDW Aggregate Service.
#
# The spring application name is rdw-reporting-aggregate-service so this file should
# be named rdw-reporting-aggregate-service when served by the configuration server.
#
# Properties that have a reasonable default value are commented out.
# Other properties are not commented out and must be provided.

# The actuator end-point is on a different port with no security because it is
# expected to be exposed only in a private subnet.
