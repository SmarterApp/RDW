# Annotated configuration for the RDW Group Processor.
#
# The spring application name is rdw-ingest-group-processor so this file should be
# named rdw-ingest-group-processor.yml when served by the configuration server.
#
# Properties that have a reasonable default value are commented out.
# Other properties are not commented out and must be provided.

# Archive configuration
# The group processor expects the student group payload to be archived and uses the database's
# native ability to directly load content from the archive. Although archiving may be done in a
# local file system the preferred solution is to use AWS S3, which requires credentials.
# For S3, the root should be the protocol and the bucket, e.g. s3://my-archive-bucket.
# The AWS access key should be for a programmatic AWS user. The secretKey should be encrypted.
# The bucket should be in the same region as the deployment (to reduce costs).
# There are no default values for these properties and they must be provided.
