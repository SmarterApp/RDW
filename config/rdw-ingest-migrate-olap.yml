# Annotated configuration for RDW Migrate OLAP
#
# The spring application name is rdw-ingest-migrate-olap so this file should be
# named rdw-ingest-migrate-olap.yml when served by the configuration server.
#
# Properties that have a reasonable default value are commented out.
# Other properties are not commented out and must be provided.

# The actuator end-point is on a different port with no security because it is expected to be
# exposed only in a private subnet. Use the default settings unless you really know what you
# are doing.

# The embargo feature applies its rules for only the current school year, so it must be configured.
# Although there is a default value for this setting (2018), it should be explicitly configured.

  # The batch size is the number of records migrated in one iteration. The aggregate data store is
  # very good at ingesting large data sets so this value can be large and defaults to 500,000.
  # Increasing it can improve migrate performance but values over 1,000,000 require a large Redshift
