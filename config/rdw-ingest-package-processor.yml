# Annotated configuration for RDW Package Processor
#
# The spring application name is rdw-ingest-package-processor so this file should be named
# rdw-ingest-package-processor.yml when served by the configuration server.
#
# Properties that have a reasonable default value are commented out.
# Other properties are not commented out and must be provided.

# Archive configuration
# The package processor expects subject definition payloads to be archived rather than
# transmitted in the ingest message. Although archiving may be done in a local file system
# during development, the preferred solution is to use AWS S3 to provide the same archive to
# both the import-service and the package-processor.  AWS S3 requires credentials.
# For S3, the root should be the protocol and the bucket, e.g. s3://my-archive-bucket.
# The AWS access key should be for a programmatic AWS user. The secretKey should be encrypted.
# The bucket should be in the same region as the deployment (to reduce costs).
# There are no default values for these properties and they must be provided.
