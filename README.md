# Reporting Data Warehouse
The Reporting Data Warehouse (RDW) is a repository for SBAC test results where those results can be viewed and analyzed: from individual student item responses, to aggregate performance results, to longitudinal trends.

This document serves as a convenient entry point to all things RDW.

How to organize this stuff? Clearly a README here (in a documentation repo) is not the same as a README in a normal repo. Should everything be in a separate markdown file with links here? Or should it be one big README with links only to other repos? And, when linking, have to link to a particular branch, should it be develop or master?
