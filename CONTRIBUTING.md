# Contributing

**Intended Audience**: this document describes the conventions used in this RDW project.

## Contributing to Documentation
* Please keep documentation **consistent**.
* Know that many different users will read this documentation from developers to operations and system administrators to application support. So make it clear **what** is being documented and **who** may find it useful.
* **Diagrams**. Some of the diagrams included in the document use [draw.io](www.draw.io). The source documents are xml files. Please use the convention of naming the source xml file the same as the image (png) file. For example `cool-picture.xml` would be the draw.io source for `cool-picture.png`.

## TODO
Bored? Here's some stuff you can do ...

* Runbook - all the service-specific chapters could use embellishment: 
* Troubleshooting - perhaps introduce a flowchart-style "what's the problem"
