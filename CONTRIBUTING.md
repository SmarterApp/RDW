# Contributing

**Inteneded Audience**: this document describes the conventions used in this RDW project.

## Contributing to Documentation
* Please keep documentation **consistent**.
* Know that many different users will read this documentation from developers to operations and system administrators to application support. So make it clear what you are documenting and who may find it useful.
* **Diagrams**. Some of the diagrams included in the document use [draw.io](www.draw.io). The source documents are xml files. Please use the convention of naming the source xml file the same as the image (png) file. For example `cool-picture.xml` would be the draw.io source for `cool-picture.png`.

## TODO
Bored? Here's some stuff you can do ...

* Clean up Runbook + Monitoring + Troubleshooting
    * Runbook should be mostly configuration; do we need multiple "chapters"?
    * Monitoring
    * Troubleshooting - perhaps two: flowchart-style "what's the problem", and a scenario-based (problem specific) guide 
* Update README.md in other projects to reference the README.md here
