## Bulk Delete Exams

**Intended Audience**:  this document provides instructions for bulk deleting exams from the Reporting Data Warehouse. Knowledge of SQL and access to the production data warehouse is required.

Deleting exams includes:
* marking exams as deleted in the warehouse
* migrating (propagating) the changes to the reporting data mart(s)

> **NOTE**: Modifying a large volume of data needs to be done with the consideration of how data is [migrated](Runbook.migrate.md#modify-lots-of-content).
> Since migrating this changes may take time, it is **strongly advisable to perform this task during the maintenance window, and while the Ingest service is paused**.   

### Other Resources
1. [Import and Migrate](Runbook.migrate.md) - Operations and system administration may find this useful with manually adjusting or cleaning up data.
1. [Migrate Reporting](#migrate-reporting)
1. [Migrate OLAP](#migrate-olap)

### Warehouse exam data store
Test result data (aka exams) depends on the following data being pre-loaded:
* Assessment packages (CSV output from the tabulator)
* Organizations
* Accommodations
* Subject configuration data
Exams data tables enforce referential integrity to the above data.

####  How test results data is stored
The data source (in a table below) refers to the [Test Results Transmission Format](http://www.smarterapp.org/documents/TestResultsTransmissionFormat.pdf) data elements. 

Table   | Data Source       |  Comment  | 
-------------- | ----------- |---------- |
student |Examinee attributes that define a student: StudentIdentifier, FirstName, MiddleName, LastOrSurname, Birthdate, Sex and so on. | If a student is not found, a new entry is created. If a student exists, but some of the student's attributes are different, they are updated.
exam |Examinee and ExamineeRelationship attributes that define a student at a time of testing (GradeLevelWhenAssessed, IDEAIndicator, LEPStatus, Section504Status, and so on), as well as Opportunity's attributes, Opportunity's 'overall' ScaleScore and PerformanceLevel data|  ExamineeRelationship refer to the Organizations data.
exam_item | Items' attributes and data elements | Exam items reference Items definition pre-loaded from the Assessment package.
exam_available_accommodation |Opportunity's Accommodations | Depends on [SBAC Accessbility Accomodataion Configuration](https://github.com/SmarterApp/AccessibilityAccommodationConfigurations/tree/RDW_DataWarehouse) being preloaded. Only accommodations deninded by this configuration are stored. 
exam_claim_score |Opportunity's claims ScaleScore and PerformanceLevel data| Depends on the subject being pre-configured with its claim scores.

### Marking exams as deleted in the warehouse (aka soft-delete)
As defined in [Import and Migrate](Runbook.migrate.md#import-id), to soft-delete exams in the warehouse a corresponding `exam` record must be marked with the `delete = 1`.
   
### Migrating (propagating) the changes to the reporting data mart(s)
As defined in [Import and Migrate](Runbook.migrate.md#create-update), the data updates must adhere to the defined pattern in order for the migrate process to propagate the changes to the data mart(s). 

### Example SQL scripts and instructions

#### Before executing the scripts
1. Stop Exam Processors.
2. Execute [validation queries](https://github.com/SmarterApp/RDW_Schema/validation-scripts) to reconcile warehouse and reporting data mart(s).
3. Check if warehouse auditing is enabled and turn it off if you do not want this action to be audited.
```sql 
# to check
mysql> use warehouse;
mysql> SELECT value FROM setting WHERE name = 'AUDIT_TRIGGER_ENABLE';

# to turn audditing off
mysql> UPDATE setting SET value = 'FALSE' WHERE name = 'AUDIT_TRIGGER_ENABLE';
```
4. Find and copy one of the queries that matches your rules for the delete.

4.1 Delete based on the test administration year

4.2 Delete based on the date range of when the test result was completed

4.3 Delete based on a specific school

4.4 Delete based on a specific assessment

4.5 Delete based on the manner of administration (Standardized or Nonstandardized)

4.6 Delete based on the Valid/Invalid

5. Open [SQL Script for Bulk Delete Exams](https://github.com/SmarterApp/RDW_Schema/bulk_delete_exam.sql) and replace the placeholder in STEP 1 with the copied query.
Continue with the steps in this SQL file.
6. Verify that migrate(s) is/are running and wait for them to complete.

### Post-validating exam deletion
8. Execute [validation queries](https://github.com/SmarterApp/RDW_Schema/validation-scripts) to reconcile warehouse and reporting data mart(s). 
9. Re-enable auditing if it was turned off in the steps above.
10. Re-start Exam Processors.

## Purging exams in the warehouse
> **NOTE: Directly modifying the database cares high risk. Refrain from doing it unless you have a strong reason.** 

**NOTE: this is not a standard operation and should only be pursued in extraordinary circumstances**

Purging exams includes:
* purging exams from the data mart(s).
* purging exam auditing data.
* purging exam from the warehouse.


### Purging from data mart
If exams were deleted using soft-delete and migration (see above) there is no need to do this: the system has already deleted the records in the data mart.
