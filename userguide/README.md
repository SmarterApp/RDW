## User Guide

There are a few documents associated with the user guide:
* [Legacy-Reporting-UserGuide.pdf](Legacy-Reporting-UserGuide.pdf). This is the User Guide for the original reporting system. This system is no longer deployed but this guide is useful for screen shots and remembering the old days.
* [reporting-system-user-guide.docx](reporting-system-user-guide.docx). This is the user guide source that provides generic documentation for RDW.
* [reporting-system-user-guide.CA.docx](reporting-system-user-guide.CA.docx), [addenda.CA.docx](addenda.CA.docx). This is a CA-specific user guide source that focuses on interim assessments (IAB, ICA) because CA is not (as of 2018-19 school year) using RDW for summative assessments. As a companion to the CA user guide there is an addenda document that documents the changes to make to the general guide to make it CA-friendly.
